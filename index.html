        <h2>Indian Cricket</h2>
        <p>
            Almost every Indian you meet will admit to having an intense love affair with cricket. 
            Emotions run high during every match. A win will see people spilling out on the streets and 
            celebrating with the entire neighbourhood. A loss, however, breaks millions of Indian hearts. 
            Cricket has often been likened to a religion in the country and these are the legends who have made the game what it is today.

        <p>
            <span>Sachin Tendulkar</span> has all the records that every cricketer dreams of. He is called the Master of Cricket or rather say the <span>God of Cricket</span>. 
            Starting his career in the age of 16, he became the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days.
            He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International,
            the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2002, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest 
            Test batsman of all time, behind <span> Don Bradman</span>, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind <span> Viv Richards</span>.
            He has won many awards in his cricketing career. These include <span>Arjuna Award, Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, Padma Shri</span> and the <span> Padma Vibhushan Award</span>.
            Moreover he is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the <span> Bharat Ratna Award</span>, India's highest civilian award.
